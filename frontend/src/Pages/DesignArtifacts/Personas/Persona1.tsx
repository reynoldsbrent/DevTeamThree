He now works for a large consulting firm. He lives alone in his apartment and usually works about 50-60 hours per week. He often has to travel to customer sites across the country. He has a lot of meetings with clients all day and his evenings are usually busy with networking events. Currently, he is subscribed to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg and checks his phone regularly for news updates. He relies heavily on X for breaking news. He is interested in using the Daily News Summary to get quick summaries of breaking news articles of the day since he doesnâ€™t have a lot of time to read full articles. ",
